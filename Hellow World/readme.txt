Module Info: 

Module 1, Assignment 1. Hello.py due_date.py
DueDate - 9/3/23

Approach:

hello.py

I created a variable called name using the input function. I also used the str() on the input function. I then used the print function with a f string to print the name variable. I realize now that the str function is not needed since I am using the f string format. 

due_date.py

I first utilized a print statement with a tripple quotation to print out a descriptive text before promting the user for info. The tripple quote allowed me to print out the text as I want with out using the \n escape method. I then propted the user to enter the day, month, year, minutes and hours that the assigment is due and I asked that it is entered in integer format. To help with space, I created all the variables in one line using one equal sign. I had to make sure each input matched up to the correct variable. I also used a backslash to break up the code so that it would fit on my screen. Finally, I printed out a statement that utilized all the variables.
